This project creates a responsive webpage with the following features:

A fixed navbar that stays at the top of the page while scrolling.
A layout consisting of three sections: a left menu, a main content area, and a right-side panel.
A collapsible left menu that can be toggled by clicking a button.
A footer that stays at the bottom of the page.
A JavaScript function that dynamically adjusts the page scale based on the screen width.
Features:
Fixed Navbar:

The navbar stays fixed at the top of the page while scrolling.
It contains links to various sections, such as Home, About, and Contact.
Collapsible Left Menu:

A button that toggles the visibility of the left menu items.
The left menu contains links that can be accessed when expanded.
Responsive Layout:

The layout is responsive and adjusts the size and appearance of the page depending on the screen size.
At larger screen sizes, the page remains full size.
For smaller screens, the page content shrinks in size to ensure readability and usability.
Page Scaling:

The page scale dynamically adjusts based on the screen width using a JavaScript function.
The scaling behavior is as follows:
If the screen width is between 992px and 1600px, the page is scaled to 90%.
If the screen width is between 700px and 767px, the page is scaled to 80%.
If the screen width is between 600px and 700px, the page is scaled to 75%.
If the screen width is less than or equal to 600px, the page is scaled to 50%.
Footer:

A footer is included at the bottom of the page with a simple copyright message
